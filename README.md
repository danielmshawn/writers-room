  ## App Description

  Have writer's block and in need of some inspiration? Have an idea you need to brainstorm with others? Have an awesome piece or scene you'd like to get notes on from fellow writers? The Writer's Room is an online community and safe space for writers to workshop, iterate, play, and most of all, get yourself out of your head and onto the page.

  There are three seperate sections:

  * **PROMPTS** - Writing prompts to get you out of your head and on to the page. Post your own distinctive writing prompt to help others, or take a crack at one and comment what you wrote below for other writers to see

  * **PITCHES** - Sometimes you need a brainstorming session. Got a sketch or character idea? Have a kernel of an idea, but need help expanding on it? Get into a back-and-forth with other writers and walk away with some clear and actionable next steps.

  * **PIECES** - Wrote a scene, but think something in it isn't working? Need another set of eyes on something after your 14th draft? This is where other writers can give you feedback on more long-form pieces of work. *It is recommended to post no more than a scene or a few pages.*
